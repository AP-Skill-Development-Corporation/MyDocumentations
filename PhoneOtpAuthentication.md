# Authenticate with Firebase on Android using a Phone Number

ou can use Firebase Authentication to sign in a user by sending an SMS message to the user's phone.
The user signs in using a one-time code contained in the SMS message.

The easiest way to add phone number sign-in to your app is to use FirebaseUI, which includes a drop-in sign-in widget that implements sign-in flows for phone number sign-in, as well as password-based and federated sign-in. This document describes how to implement a 
phone number sign-in flow using the Firebase SDK.

Phone numbers that end users provide for authentication will be sent and stored by Google to improve our spam and abuse prevention across Google services, 
including but not limited to Firebase. Developers should ensure they have appropriate end-user consent prior to using the Firebase Authentication phone number
sign-in service.
